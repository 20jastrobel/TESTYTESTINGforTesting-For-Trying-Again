# LLM Handoff Context: Hardcoded-Only Hubbard Pipeline (No Qiskit in Production Path)

## Purpose
This file is designed to be pasted into another LLM.  
That LLM should return a **copy-pasteable instruction prompt** for Codex to implement a new pipeline in this repository.

Important: **Do not implement anything yet** based on this file. This is context and handoff only.

## User’s Exact Message (Verbatim)
> Create a MD file designed to be fed to a LLM. Then, this LLM will give me a prompt to give you the prompt that LLM will give me. This prompt relates to implementing a pipeline independent of Qiskit, so it solely utilizes the hardcoded scripts. It will take the Firm Ionic Hubbard Hamiltonian, Jordan Wigner Map it, utilize VQE and QPE the hardcoded versions, and then Suzuki Trotter hardcoded Time Evolve it. I do not want you to implement any of this yet. I want you simply to make the MD file explaining the repo and include this message in that MD file. Then I will copy and paste that MD file into an LLM. Which will provide me a copy-pasteable instruction set for you to implement these changes in a specific way.

## Repository Summary
- Repo focus: operator-first Hubbard/JW algebra with hardcoded quantum workflows.
- Core package path: `pydephasing/quantum/`
- Tests and runnable scripts: `Tests/`
- Current workspace has generated validation artifacts for L=2/3/4 matching runs and PDF reports.

## Critical Conventions (from `AGENTS.md`)
- Internal Pauli alphabet: `e/x/y/z` (`e` is identity).
- Pauli string ordering: left-to-right is `q_(n-1) ... q_0`; qubit 0 is rightmost character.
- JW ladder source of truth: use:
  - `fermion_plus_operator(repr_mode="JW", nq, j)`
  - `fermion_minus_operator(repr_mode="JW", nq, j)`
  from `pydephasing/quantum/pauli_polynomial_class.py`
- Number operator convention: `n_p = (I - Z_p)/2`, consistent with qubit-order convention.
- Keep operator algebra core clean:
  - `pauli_letters_module.py`
  - `qubitization_module.py`
  - `pauli_polynomial_class.py`
- No Qiskit in core production VQE path; Qiskit is validation-only.

## Relevant Existing Hardcoded Assets
- Hubbard builder:
  - `pydephasing/quantum/hubbard_latex_python_pairs.py`
- Hardcoded VQE/UCCSD logic exists in notebook code cells:
  - `pydephasing/quantum/vqe_latex_python_pairs_test.ipynb`
- New hardcoded-vs-Qiskit matching harness (L=2):
  - `Tests/phase1_l2_hardcoded_match_harness.py`
- New L=3/L=4 hardcoded-vs-Qiskit time-dynamics PDF comparator:
  - `Tests/l3_l4_hardcoded_vs_qiskit_time_dynamics_pdf.py`

## Recently Generated Validation Outputs
- L2:

  - `hardcoded_vs_qiskit_l2_l4_overall_summary.pdf`
- Command audit log:
  - `phase1_commands_run.txt`

## What the Future Implementation Prompt Should Ask Codex To Build
The next prompt (to be generated by another LLM) should instruct Codex to implement a **single hardcoded-only pipeline**, independent of Qiskit in production flow, that:
1. Builds the **Fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonian**.
2. Applies **Jordan–Wigner mapping** using repo-consistent hardcoded operators/conventions.
3. Runs **hardcoded VQE**.
4. Runs **hardcoded QPE**.
5. Runs **hardcoded Suzuki–Trotter time evolution**.

## Constraints The Generated Prompt Should Preserve
- Do not change Pauli ordering conventions.
- Do not add Qiskit into production modules.
- Keep algorithm logic out of operator-algebra core modules.
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes with explicit tests/artifacts.
- Ensure outputs are reproducible and auditable (JSON metrics + PDF plots where relevant).

## Output Request to the Other LLM
Please return a **single copy-pasteable prompt** for Codex that:
- Is implementation-ready.
- Is explicit about file targets, constraints, acceptance checks, and deliverables.
- Uses this repository’s conventions and module boundaries exactly.
